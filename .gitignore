Can't seem to get ArtifactDB excluded from GitHub
Question

Getting old having to manually find/exclude it with every check in. Never had this before with non unity code.

All the Ignored files I have.

Library/ArtifactDB
Library\ArtifactDB
ArtifactDB
\ArtifactDB
/ArtifactDB
*ArtifactDB
/[Bb]uilds/
/[Ll]ogs/
[Ll]ibrary/

I have never experienced 1 overwriting the other, so haven't tried each individually.

# macOS cruft
.DS_Store

# Windows cruft
Thumbs.db
[Dd]esktop.ini

# Unity
/[Ll]ibrary/
/[Tt]emp/
/[Oo]bj/
/[Bb]uild/
/[Bb]uilds/
/[Ll]ogs/
/[Uu]ser[Ss]ettings/

# MemoryCaptures can get excessive in size.
# They also could contain extremely sensitive data
/[Mm]emoryCaptures/

# Recordings can get excessive in size
/[Rr]ecordings/
